# Solware+ ðŸŒ 

A Visual Studio Code theme for the solware team developers. Fine-tuned for those of us who like to code late into the night. Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness and in low-light circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading comprehension and for optimal razzle dazzle. âœ¨

About this theme, and some of the considerations made while creating it (as well as _how_ to create it should you want to make your own): [https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/)

```

## Preferences for pair colorization

In your `settings.json` pass `editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled` to `true`, then paste in the custom palette.

```
"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
	"editorBracketHighlight.foreground1": "#5caeef",
	"editorBracketHighlight.foreground2": "#dfb976",
	"editorBracketHighlight.foreground3": "#c172d9",

	"editorBracketHighlight.foreground5": "#97c26c",
	"editorBracketHighlight.foreground6": "#abb2c0",
	"editorBracketHighlight.unexpectedBracket.foreground": "#db6165"
}
```

## Misc

This is my first foray into creating a theme, so if you see something wrong, please feel free to contact me on Teams, I'm sure there are things I missed.

This palette was inspired in part by "gatsby-highlight" plugin [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-remark-highlight-code/).
